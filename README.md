# Data_analyzed

This is the final project of Basic Machine Learning from Indoensia.ai course. Here, i use Breast Cancer dataset and trying some machine learning algorithm and compare them to get the best detection result. I also do some preprocessing, doing PCA to reduce the number of the features so they will be not correlated to each other, and for the final journey, i compared Support Vector Machine with both linear and rbf kernel, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and also KNN for the classification purposed
