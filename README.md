# AirBnB data analyzed and visualization

This is the final project of Intermediate Python from Indoensia.ai course. Here, i use AirBnB dataset from kaggle.com and trying to process the data and get the necessary information by doing some visualization of the datasaet's extract information

# Breast Cancer Classification Project

This is the final project of Basic Machine Learning from Indoensia.ai course. Here, i use Breast Cancer dataset and trying some machine learning algorithm and compare them to get the best classification model based on the model's evaluation result. I also do some preprocessing, doing PCA to reduce the number of the features so they will be not correlated to each other, and for the final journey, i compared Support Vector Machine with both linear and rbf kernel, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and also KNN for the classification purposed

# Forest fires Deep Learning Project

This is the final project of Deep Learning from Indoensia.ai course. Here, i use Forest Fires dataset and trying some kind of Neural Network layer combination and compare one to each other to get the best model. I build the model by using Tensorflow, by utilizing Ternsorflow keras and make some sequential Neural Network and use it to doing the classification and regression experiment's purposed. I make 4 different NN model and trying some experiments by utilizing them and doing some adjustment to the epoch, optimizer and so on to get the best result. Before feed the data into these model, i also do some preprocessing first to make sure the data is ready to feed and reducing the bias of the data to prevent misinterpret of the deep learning model and get the best result.
